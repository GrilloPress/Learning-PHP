# Learning PHP

Learning PHP is a book about learning how to create applications with PHP.

It features highly focused chapters with multiple sections all with a concrete goal.

These goals are two-fold. Learning how to do something that you will need to use frequently (like create Classes, Functions etc.) coupled with a practical
end-goal.

So, learning to create functions is both about learning how to create functions as well as using them in anger.

This dual passive learning and active use of a concept is the best teaching method. Think of it like a mixture of "Learn x the Hard Way" and "Get Shit Done" combined.

This book may never get completed. That is highly likely. But, enjoy anyway.
